# CI-CD

This project is for Jenkins CI/CD. I am writing jenkins file for ci & cd stages of various applications. 
The first application is multi-app which static app based on html, css, js. 
The second application is node.js based book management system. 

So I am using single file for building ci for both projects depending on git recent commit occured on which project folder. 
After identifying that we are moving to build app code package or bundle from this.
